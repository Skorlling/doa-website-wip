        <h3>Exclusion Zone Authority</h3>
        <div class="perma-2-column-grid">
            <p>The Exclusion Zone Authority is a federal agency responsible for operating the various exclusion zones within the United States and keeping the public safe from the danger they pose. The EZA was established in 1953 as a consolidation of the at-the-time 5 Exclusion Zone Authorities, who, up until that point, had operated as individual agencies.</p>
