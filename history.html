        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>On July 16, 1945, the world's first, and last, nuclear detonation occurred. Scientists watched as the New Mexico desert was transformed from night to day. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory spoke the only quote he felt fitting; Let there be light. Moments later, the detonation seemed to implode upon itself, before the Beyond burst through. Following only a cursory investigation of what had occurred, the area was quickly evacuated and closed off. Further research into the test brought no breakthroughs, and it seemed no one truly understood what had occurred.</p>
        <p>With the test considered a failure and too dangerous to be repeated, the United States lost its secret weapon in the war. Instead, forces were instructed to renew their firebombing campaigns while plans were prepared for an invasion of Japan proper. However, before this plan could be initiated, Japan's military high command came to recognize their inevitable defeat, and on December 3rd, 1945, World War 2 came to a close with Japan's formal surrender. With the military thereafter freed from overseas obligations, they were quickly remobilized to contain the growing chaos at the Trinity Site, leading to the establishment of the Trinity Exclusion Zone in February 1946.</p>
        <p>Despite attempts to keep what had occurred under wraps, information gradually spread out of classified areas to the public, especially as additional exclusion zones began to be created. Much outrage ensued; many overlooked the intention of the test and instead focused on the danger it had created. This was especially true for religious organizations, who compared Trinity and the Manhattan Project as a whole to the Tower of Babel. Congress was no different, as, with massive support, they quickly began creating new legislation to limit the military presence and prevent future disasters. As part of this, new federal agencies were created to transition the various zones to complete civilian control. Military control of the zones finally came to a close with the passage of the Otherworldly Oversight Act in 1948, and the official creation of the Department of Otherworldly Affairs.</p>
